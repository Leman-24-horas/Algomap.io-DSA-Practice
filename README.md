# Data Structures and Algorithms Practice - Algomap.io
*by Aditya Kumar Bhardwaj*

## Overview
This repository documents all the LeetCode problems I have attemped and solved as part of my efforts to strengthen my programming skills and improve my understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms. All code written is in Java. 

## Categories
All LeetCode problems in this repository are classified into the following categories:

1. Arrays & Strings
2. Hashmaps & Sets
3. Two pointers
4. Stacks
5. Linked Lists
6. Binary Search
7. Sliding Window
8. Trees
9. Heaps
10. Recursive Backtracking
11. Graphs

## Clone  this Repository
``` 
git clone https://github.com/Leman-24-horas/Algomap.io-DSA-Practice.git
```

## Future Plans
The immediate focus will be on building a stronger foundation in Recursive BackTracking, following which the next steps will involve tackling Graphs and Dynamic Programming.
